# Rstudio Git(Hub) tutorial

## Target Audience

This tutorial is specifically written for students assigned a simple team
project using RStudio, who want to collaborate on coding using GitHub.

```{important}
This context means we will teach you how to work with others with GitHub in the
simplest way possible. No fancy wizardry, we just want to turn RStudio into
something like "Google Docs but for code."
```
