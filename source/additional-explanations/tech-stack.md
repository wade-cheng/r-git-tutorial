# Why This Tech Stack?

We asked you to use this set of tools:

- R
- RStudio
- Git
- GitHub

## Why R?

R is a domain specific programming language that is particularly used in
statistics.

## Why RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R (and some other
stuff!). Dedicated software for developing code can offer unique advantages
over, say, writing everything in Windows Notepad and running everything by
manually using `Rscript myscript.R` in your terminal.

RStudio offers the ability to view code, plots, saved variables, and formatted
spreadsheet files.

It lets users create `.Rmd` and other types of notebook files to mix text and
code. Blocks and lines of code can be run in arbitrary order, enabling rapid
prototyping. It can convert the notebook plaintext into formatted HTML or pdf.

And most notably (for this guide), it provides a visual interface to the
command-line version control system Git.

## Why Git?

[](./why-version-control.md) explains why version control systems are good. Git
is a (possibly the most) popular VCS, used in industry and personal projects
alike.

There are arguments against it, but it's popular, and what the Author is
familiar with.

## Why GitHub?

GitHub, among other things, is a cloud storage provider for projects managed
with Git.

We use it because it's popular, and what the Author is familiar with.

## An Analogy

- Writing
- a book
- with MS Word
- and using your computer's "drag and drop" function
- to upload the files to Google Drive

is analogous to

- coding
- a statistics report
- with RStudio
- and using Git (or RStudio's Git GUI)
- to upload the files to GitHub.
